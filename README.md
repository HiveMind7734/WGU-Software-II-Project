# WGU-Software-II-Project
This is a scheduling application

You can create a schedule using this application. It ensures you don't overlap times and queries your operating system for the current time zone. The application will automatically convert times from different time zones so the user does not have to.

How to open the application:

1. Download and extract the WGU-Software-II-Project.zip
2.Open the JDBCApp with your favorite IDE
3.Click the play on the JDBCApp
4.Enter the user name and password below
5.Navigate the app and create a schedule!

The username and password are:

username: test
password: password

I don't know how long Udacity will give me access to their database. (I think until 2021) 

Note: You could use a memory dump tool to extract the username and password. It is lacking in some security features.
