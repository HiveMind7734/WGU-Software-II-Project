# WGU-Software-II-Project
This is a scheduling application

I was feeling solicitous when turning this into the grading team. The reason why is that there is some spaghetti code in there.  This version did pass all the requirements of the automated grading script that they use to test program functionally! Please reach out to me if you have questions about this project. Thank you for viewing.

I don't know how long Udacity will give me access to their database. (I think until 2021)
